----------------------------------------------------

This program reads the data consisting of x and y from a file
and stores it in a 2D array.Then it finds out a value of y when
some random x is given, which must be in between the first
and last x value of the table.

The table with x and y values is given below: 

  1.00  2.00  3.00  4.00  5.00  6.00  7.00  8.00  9.00
 11.11 12.12 13.13 14.14 15.15 16.16 17.17 18.18 19.19

The corresponding value of x, 1.50, is 11.6150.

The corresponding value of x, 3.00, is 13.1300.
