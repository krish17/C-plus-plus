---------------------------------------------

This program reads the data consisting of x and y from a file
and stores it in a 2D array.Then it finds out a value of y when
some random x is given, which must be in between the first
and last x value of the table.

The table with x and y values is given below: 

  3.00  3.30  3.60  4.00  4.50
 14.90 18.20 22.30 27.20 33.30

The corresponding value of x, 3.00, is 14.9000.

The corresponding value of x, 4.10, is 28.4200.
